              Hi! 👋 Welcome to Insights Bot!

              I currently support these commands:

              {{ .Commands }}
          cancel:
            help: Cancel the current activated operation

      notification: |
        {{.Name}} @{{.Username}} It looks like this group has been upgraded to a <b>supergroup</b> from a <b>basic group</b>. When this happens, the chat ID of the group will change. <b>I've automatically migrated the previous chat history and data to the new chat ID</b>, and the old bot settings will continue to apply.

        However, please note that due of Telegram's limitation, the old messages IDs will no longer be compatible with future messages. Therefore the next time I generate recapture, I will not include messages those were sent before the migration. Thank you for your understanding.

    welcome:

        🤗 Welcome to @{{.Username}}!

        - To let me read a webpage, try out this command /smr@{{.Username}} <code>Link</code>;

        - To let me summarize the chat history in this group, please promote me <b>manually</b> (no actual admin right is required), and send /configure_recap@{{.Username}} <b>using your own identity</b> (recommended, or I may confuse about the admins) to start configuring the chat recapturing for this group.

        - If you want to delete the data stored by the Bot after adding it as an admin, you can demote the bot to trigger the automatic deletion of all history data (Note this behavior can be changed from code by the Bot owner in custom instances).

        Having other questions? You can also:

        1. Use /help@{{.Username}} to list all available commands;
        2. Submit your question to the developers in an Issue on the Bot's <a href="https://github.com/nekomeowww/insights-bot">GitHub repository</a>.

        Good luck and enjoy the bot!

        ⚠️ Note: Your group is not a supergroup. <b>Linking back messages will not work in basic groups.</b>

        If you would like me to use message links for referencing, doing one of these will make it work:

        - Changing this group to public and change it back immediately;
        - Using other approaches to upgrade this group to a supergroup;
